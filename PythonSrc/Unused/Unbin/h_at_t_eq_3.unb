# After a ball is thrown upward at t = 0 (seconds),
# from an initial height of 5 feet, and an upwards velocity of 40 (feet/sec),
# find the height of a ball at t = 3 (seconds).
#
# Use the formula h(t) = (1/2) * g * t**2 + v_0 * t + h_0
h_0 = 5    # feet
v_0 = 50   # feet/sec
g   = -32  # gravity (negative = downward)
t   = 3

half_g      = g / 2
t_squared   = t * t
h_acc       = half_g * t_squared

h_vel       = v_0 * t

h_acc_vel   = h_acc + h_vel
h_at_t_eq_3 = h_acc_vel + h_0
